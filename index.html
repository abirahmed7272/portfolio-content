		<h1>A Little About Me</h1>
		<p>I've been playing videogames ever since I got out of the womb. My first console 
			was my brother's PS2 and this brought my love for sports games 
			like WWE: Smackdown vs. Raw and NBA Live. Ever since then, I've moved on to new
			 gaming systems like the 3DS, PS3, PS4, PS5, mobile gaming, and PC gaming.
			I fell in love with different genres of video games and explored the various 
			character models that developers make.</p>

		<!-- Make sure your anchor tags have a link (href) and a clickable component -->
		<p>Unlocking a new character in video games became almost like collecting different
			trading cards. Not everyone enjoys video games but everyone loves a story with
			 great visuals and characters.
		</p>

		<p>Countinue to browse through my pages to see some of my favorite video game
			characters and learn a little about their backgrounds.
