		<h2>A Little About Me</h2>
		<p>
		I've been playing videogames ever since I got out of the womb. My first console 
		was my brother's PS2 and this brought my love for sports games 
		like WWE: Smackdown vs. Raw and NBA Live. Ever since then, I've moved on to new
			gaming systems like the 3DS, PS3, PS4, PS5, mobile gaming, and PC gaming.
		I fell in love with different genres of video games and explored the various 
		character models that developers make.
		
		
			<div>
			Unlocking a new character in video games became almost like collecting different
			trading cards. Not everyone enjoys video games but everyone loves a story with
				great visuals and characters.
			</div>
			
			
			<div>Countinue to browse through my pages to see some of my favorite video game
			characters and learn a little about their backgrounds.
