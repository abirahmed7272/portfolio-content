					Farah Ahmed Karim is one of the few eye-catching characters from Call of Duty, the popular first-person shooter series from the past two decades. With the reboot of Modern Warfare in 2019, Farah caught attention
					as the Leading Commander of the Urzikstan Liberation Force that killed the antogonist Roman Barkov in order to establish liberation for her 
					country. She resonates with many Muslims and Middle Eastern gamers as they see a Muslim woman taking down an oppressor. She is shown in multiple 
					shots which shows the different depictions of Muslims. They can be shown in complete hijabs, partial covering of hair, or no covering of hair.

					Captain Takeo Masaki appears in multiple Call of Duty Zombies modes from titles like Black Ops 1/2/3, CoD Mobile, and almost in every CoD 
					developed by Treyarch. He's known for being the imfamous Japanse soldier from the Imperial Japanese Army who fights alongside his American, German,
					and Russian partner to fight against the horde of zombies. His appearance is quite a favorite amongst players as they like the samurai-like characteristics
					that he presents. He appears with his katana, hair in a bun, and in distressed clothing from Imperial Japan. Japanese representation brought more diversity
					into the series. Activision even decided to make his model playable within CoD Mobile, so you can capture objectives on the go with a katana behind the back.
					"Our journey to victory has begun! Death to MPLA" are the most memorable lines of Jonas Savimbi. Savimbi appears in Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 as political
					leader who led UNITA against the communists of MPLA of Angola. Although his emphasis as a Black character is less prominent, gamers are able to see the strength that
					exists amongst Africa. Players will recognize the character for his use of the MM1 grenade launcher as he plows through enenmies alongside the main character to 
					eventually see a victory.
