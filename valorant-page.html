						Valorant is PC-exclusive first-person shooter game and Neon is one of the character with special abilities.
						Neon is a Filipino Agent with bright electric hair and can move forward at the speed of light.
						She is known for her ability to sprint around corners and "slide-cancel" like a Call of Duty player. Her Overdrive special ability grants her 
						full power and speed, even allowing her to shoot a damaging lightning beam.

					<p class="content" id="cypher">
						Cypher is a sentinel Agent from Morocca, with the abilty to flash and perform high IQ game-winning plays. The agent moves in silence as an information broker, while 
						keeping tabs on enemy movements. Famous Valorant streamers like Dasnerth are known for using the agent with a shotgun to outplay some Valorant pros and even make them 
						rage. Cypher's Neutral Theft special abilty allows the user to instantly reveal enemy locations through intel from a dead enemy player.

				</div>
					<p class="content" id="sova">
						Sova stems from the cold parts of Russia as an inittiator agent. He's able to make way for duelests like Neon by reveling enemy location with his bow and arrow, shock them,
						or even fly out a drone if needed. This agent is great for players that are just getting into the game, trying to play passive, and be a team player. The Hunter's Fury special 
						ability allows Sova to deal damage through walls and even reveal their location at the same time.
