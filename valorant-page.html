		<p>
			Valorant is PC-exclusive first-person shooter game. With 13 rounds, 2 teams of 5 use gunplay 
			and character exclusive abilities to eliminate the enemy team, plant the bomb, or even defuse 
			the bomb, round by round. Each character is special in their own way, using firearms or even 
			superpowers to defeat the enemy team. Because of the effort placed into character uniqness and 
			map design, the game is played and viewed worldwide on Twitch, a streaming platform for gamers.

			Neon is a Filipino Agent with bright electric hair and can move forward at the speed of light.

			Cypher is a sentinel Agent from Morocca, with the abilty to flash and perform high IQ game-winning plays. The agent moves in silence as an information broker, while 
			keeping tabs on enemy movements. Famous Valorant streamers like Dasnerth are known for using the agent with a shotgun to outplay some Valorant pros and even make them 
			rage. Cypher's Neutral Theft special abilty allows the user to instantly reveal enemy locations through intel from a dead enemy player.

		<p>
			Sova stems from the cold parts of Russia as an inittiator agent. He's able to make way for duelests like Neon by reveling enemy location with his bow and arrow, shock them,
			 or even fly out a drone if needed. This agent is great for players that are just getting into the game, trying to play passive, and be a team player. The Hunter's Fury special 
			 ability allows Sova to deal damage through walls and even reveal their location at the same time.
