	<main>
		<p>Valorant is PC-exclusive first-person shooter game. With 13 rounds, 2 teams of 5 use gunplay 
			and character exclusive abilities to eliminate the enemy team, plant the bomb, or even defuse 
			the bomb, round by round. Each character is special in their own way, using firearms or even 
			superpowers to defeat the enemy team. Because of the effort placed into character uniqness and 
			map design, the game is played and viewed worldwide on Twitch, a streaming platform for gamers.
